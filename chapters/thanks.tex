\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Murray Elder for being my supervisor through honours even after changing universities, for sending me to the AMSI summer school so that I could learn about geometric group theory, and for making it possible for me to attend three international conferences in Spain related to my research (something that would otherwise be unheard-of for an Honours student).
I would also like to thank Murray Elder for his help in filling out the terse forms that universities require and for his suggestions for my thesis.

I would like to thank Thomas Murray for his work on a summer research project which has become a preliminary study into the plausibility of this honours thesis.

I thank Anne Thomas and Lawrence Reeves for teaching me geometric group theory, without whom I wouldn't have an understanding of the area and would thus be lost with my project.
Also, I thank the organisers of the 2017 AMSI summer school for running this course.

I thank the organisers of the 2017 conferences yGAGTA and GAGTA, and the organisers of the 2017 conference Groups of Intermediate Growth in Seville.
