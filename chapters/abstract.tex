\chapter*{Abstract}

An open question in geometric group theory is whether there exists a group with intermediate geodesic growth.
That is, a group for which the function which counts the number of length $n$ geodesics grows faster than any polynomial and slower than any exponential; a potential example for this property is the Fabrykowski-Gupta group.

This thesis will present an efficient algorithm for computing the geodesics of the Fabrykowski-Gupta group with the objective being to provide a computation-based experimental method for studying the geodesic growth of this and similar examples.
This algorithm will be shown to have a worst-case time complexity given by
\[
  O\left(
    \sum_{\ell=1}^{n} s(\ell-1) \log s(\ell-1) \ell \log \ell 
  \right)
\]
where $n$ is the length of geodesic to generate, and $s(n)$ is the strict growth of the Fabrykowski-Gupta group, which will be shown to be a great improvement over the previously known brute force method.
This paper will end with a presentation of the data generated by the algorithm.
