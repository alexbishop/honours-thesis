\chapter{Self-Similar Groups}

\section{Wreath Products}

%TODO
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define the wreath product
	\item Define (restricted) wreath recursion
	\item Define the mapping $\varphi : G \to H \wr K$ where $G \cong H \wr K$
	\item Define $\Phi$ to be the inverse of $\varphi$
	\item Maybe define $\left\llangle \cdot \right\rrangle: H^K \to G$ to be the inverse of $\varphi$ restricted to $H^K$ ?\\
	E.g. the Fabrykowski-Gupta group can be defined by $z = \left\llangle t,1,z \right\rrangle$ or $z = \Phi(t,1,z)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Regular Rooted Trees}

The definitions and ideas of this section have been taken from \cite{ElderTech2}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Give a geometric interpretation of an $r$-regular rooted tree
	\item Give a geometric interpretation of the automorphism group on such a tree
	\item Give a more intuitive interpretation of wreath products as automorphism of a tree
	\item Give an example of the automorphism group of the ternary rooted tree defined as the wreath recursion $\Aut(\mathcal{T}_3) = \Aut(\mathcal{T}_3) \wr \mathbb{Z}_3$
\end{itemize}

\section{Self-Similarity}

%TODO
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a self-similar group
	\item Give the odometer group as an example
	\item Define finite automata
\end{itemize}

\section{Contracting Groups}

%TODO
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a contracting group
	\item Give a simple example, e.g. the odometer group
	\item All contracting groups have solvable word problems (small proof)
\end{itemize}
